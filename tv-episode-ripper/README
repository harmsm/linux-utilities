This is a basic--somewhat hacked--workflow that can be used to rip a large 
number of episodes of a tv show from dvd, then load in appropriate meta data.

The basic flow:
    ripper.sh -- automates ripping all tracks off of a given dvd
    xml/xmlFlattener.py
        Takes all xml files in a directory (presumably downloaded off of a tv
        metadata website) and creates a flat ";" delimited file.  It also cleans
        up any messed up unicode that might have come through.  A set of example
        xml files (and .jpg thumbnails) is in the xml directory.
    xml/createAtomicParsleyBash.py:
        Takes flat file from last step and uses to copy all of the mp4s from 
        ripper.sh into ones with sane names, then generates a bash script that
        will run AtomicParsley on each file to load in appropriate metadata.
